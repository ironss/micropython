Functions to implement
======================

* chdir
* getcwd
  LittleFS does not remember current directory. 
  Add a member to mp_obj_littlefs_vfs_t to remember the current directory,
  and append this to the path in every function that takes a path.

* del
  Not sure what this is for, but it is only enabled if FS_REENTRANT is set.

File operations
---------------
* stream_read
* stream_readinto
* stream_unbuffered_readline
* stream_unbuffered_readlines
* stream_write
* stream_flush
* stream_close
* stream_seek
* stream_tell


Tests
=====

* Verify basic read/write operations
* Use LFS as the boot filesystem


VFS API changes
===============

When first mounting a filesystem, there is no good way to tell the system
what type of filesystem it should be. Also, autodetection is not particularly
good. At this stage, it is probably better to allow the caller to pass in the
type of filesystem as a parameter.

os.mount() (or C function vfs_mount()) now accepts an additional optional 
keyword-only parameter fstype. The default value is 'None', in which case
it should try to autodetect, but the implementation just tries to mount
at FAT filesystem.

Otherwise, it should be a filesystem type (VfsLittleFS or VfsFat).
