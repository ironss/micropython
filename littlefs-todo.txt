Functions to implement
======================

* chdir
* getcwd
  LittleFS does not remember current directory. 
  Add a member to mp_obj_littlefs_vfs_t to remember the current directory,
  and append this to the path in every function that takes a path.

* del
  Not sure what this is for, but it is only enabled if FS_REENTRANT is set.

File operations
---------------
* stream_read
* stream_readinto
* stream_unbuffered_readline
* stream_unbuffered_readlines
* stream_write
* stream_flush
* stream_close
* stream_seek
* stream_tell


Tests
=====

* Verify basic read/write operations
* Use LFS as the boot filesystem
